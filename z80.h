 *  This class abstracts the usage of the retroshield to drive a Z80.

 *  The intention is that you can instantiate an instance of this class
 *  and ensure it operates but keep the details of RAM & I/O inside your
 *  main-sketch.
 *
 *  You provide a callback to be invoked when RAM is read/written, and
 *  they are missing you'll end up with a free-running system.
